SPEECH OF PRESENTATION: 

First of all, the name of our topic is Hashing and collision So before knowing about the Hashing and collision,
you have to take about the history of the hashing, which means when, where, how or why the hashing was made. 
Its discovery was not as easy as it sounds. There are a lot of huge things behind this. During our research, 
we learned this from certain experts. 

Now let's get started.The time was in June of the 1941 in a corner of America for a computer lab called SVL,
it is a IBM computer research facilities. At that time, Sir Hans Peter Luhn was appointed as a head of  
Information Retrieval Research Department here. James Perry and Malcolm Dyson brought a problem to this department of IBM in 1947. The challenge was to search chemical compounds that had been stored in coded form. This was the first Luhn was introduced to the experimenting field of information and documentation science. He used to provide solutions, but at that time the available machines also had their limitations. He then had to find new methods to overcome these limitations. And the 1950s came which was the ‘computer age’. Luhn had started spending a great deal amount of time on the challenges of the information retrieval system. In 1953 Luhn had the idea to put all the information in a bucket. He predicted that this would make searching faster. And this information can consist of numbers as well as text. Luhn’s invention was further shaped and modified by scientists of the coming generation . And now we call this thing Hashing.

Here we give the path way to cover the full hashing and Collision.
Now let's get to the main point of "what hashing is"-
Hashing is a technique of mapping a large chunk of data into small tables using a hashing function. 
A particular piece of information can also be found from a group using hashing.Let us understand this with a simple example 
Students are assigned a special unique roll number in schools or universities.With the help of that all the information about that student is available. Like his name, class, address etc.
Those of you who know about php and sql  then you will know how to get this information well, and those of you who do not know about this matter have nothing to fear, you will know later.
In hashing, in this way, each object is given a key with the help of which its information can be retrieved.

Next point is "which ability have hashing"-
Some key points are as follows 
*) In hashing, large keys can also be changed to small keys.
*) All information is stored in a table called Hash table, so there is no difficulty in searching.
*)Its main mantra(law) is to be able to do all kinds of work within O(1) time.

Now "how to implement hashing"
It uses the Hash function to convert the element to a number that is stored in the Hashtable as a key.Here's an attempt to show how it does this.And it is good to mention that every division time is divided by 10 for ease of understanding First, take 11 and divide it by 10 and get 1, so here 11 is placed at index 1 in this hash-table.
Now, take 12 and divide it by 10 and get 2, so here 12 is placed at index 2 in this hash-table.
In this way all were done and placed in their proper places.

The next question -
"What is Hash function"
Hash function is any function that can be convert any simple text to a hashed text and fixed arbitrary size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values or hash codes.
Now hash table
Hash table is used to store keys pairs and It is nothing but a special type of array. The average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1) time.
Advantages of hash table-
*)Hash table is more apparent when the number of entries is large.
